    "caption_popup": "The phrase \"interned Japanese\" is inaccurate. Many were U.S. citizens. We would replace the phrase with a more accurate description of who was being affected, something like \"local Japanese American business owners who are being forcibly incarcerated by order of EEO9066.\" The important part of this story is that these were U.S. citizens and residents being forcibly incarcerated by order of U.S. law -- a key fact we would foreground today."
