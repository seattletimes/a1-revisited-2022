When we ask people to pose for portraits, we ensure that the image is clearly a portrait and work with the person on how they are depicted, including whether they want to smile. These images fail to meet those standards. If we would have used a photo of soldiers, we would have reduced the size in order to place more emphasis on the people who are most impacted. "

U.S. citizens are not beholden to the Japanese government, and Japanese American business owners were being \"put out of business\" because of the executive order. We would also include quotes and perspectives from business owners who were stripped of their livelihoods and being denied refunds on licenses. This article would be expanded to include all of these important aspects."

We would recognize this today as an unbalanced perspective and one which may be influenced by fear of retaliation or of appearing to be against the U.S. government at a time of high anti-Japanese sentiment. Given this difficulty, we would offer anonymity to those sources, seek out sources with different perspectives and consider ways to protect sources willing to share perspectives that could endanger them. We would also plan follow-up stories that investigated the conditions at the incarceration camps."

It was three months old at the time of publication and it didn’t need to be on Page One; its accompanying story is far inside the paper. Instead, we would move up the story about Bainbridge Island residents being forced to leave their homes, and use two or three photos from Bainbridge, the ferry and the train as residents were being taken away."

We would not reduce local news of the U.S. government forcing its own citizens from their homes to a bottom corner of the front page. We would not use such innocuous language in the headline: These Bainbridge Island residents are not “bidding it farewell,” they are being taken away and forced to leave everything they own behind. “Smiles” reads like propaganda. Today, we would write a headline at the top of the page making it clear that Japanese American residents of Bainbridge were being forced to leave their homes due to a federal policy."
